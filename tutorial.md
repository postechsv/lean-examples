# Tutorial: Verifying the Bakery Algorithm

This tutorial explains how to verify the safety of Lamport's Bakery Algorithm using the **DMC-Logic** framework. We will walk through encoding the system transitions, defining inductive invariants, and proving mutual exclusion.

## 1. Representing Rewrite Theories

In DMC-Logic, the system state is represented by a configuration `Conf`. The transitions between states are defined using an inductive proposition `Step`. 

The Bakery algorithm uses a global ticket counter (`t`) and a serving counter (`s`). Processes move through states: `idle` → `wait` → `crit`.

```lean
inductive Step : Conf → Conf → Prop where
  -- A process picks a ticket (t) and moves to wait state
  | wake : ∀ n m : Nat, ∀ ps : ProcSet,
      Step {t := n,      s := m, c := {$[idle]}   + ps}
           {t := succ n, s := m, c := {$[wait n]} + ps}

  -- A process enters the critical section if its ticket matches the serving counter (s)
  | crit : ∀ n m : Nat, ∀ ps : ProcSet,
      Step {t := n, s := m, c := {$[wait m]} + ps}
           {t := n, s := m, c := {$[crit m]} + ps}

  -- A process exits, incrementing the serving counter
  | exit : ∀ n m : Nat, ∀ ps : ProcSet,
      Step {t := n, s := m,      c := {$[crit m]} + ps}
           {t := n, s := succ m, c := {$[idle]} + ps}

## 2. Representing Inductive Invariants
To prove safety, we define predicates that describe all "reachable" and "safe" states. We categorize the system state into three main phases:

### Initial State
The system starts with the ticket and serving counters equal, and all processes `idle`.

```lean
def init_pred (cf : Conf) : Prop :=
  cf.t = cf.s ∧ is cf.c
```
